This repository includes a simple Resume Optimizer widget. The widget can be embedded on any HTML page and provides a basic analysis comparing a resume to a job description.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and start the server:

```bash
cd resume_optimizer
npm install
node server.js
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Features

- Upload a PDF or DOCX resume
- Enter a job description or URL
- See a match score before and after suggested keyword additions
- Download an optimized PDF containing the missing keywords

The code is intentionally lightweight and modular so it can be extended.
